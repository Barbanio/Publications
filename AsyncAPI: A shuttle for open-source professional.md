# AsyncAPI: A shuttle for open-source professionals 


We all start studying and training in what we like with a lot of enthusiasm and optimism. However, as time goes by, difficulties begin to arise, making us rethink our position and values. Are we really good at what we thought we were? Are we in the good direction? Are we investing our time correctly? Do really our skills define us? Who are we, after all? Shall we go on?

Hopes and expectations always appear as two key concepts. They go hand in hand from the moment we think about what we want to train in, what we would like to do, and how we imagine ourselves in the future.

And if we are a little bit stubborn, or we just made the right choices when choosing our studies, we finally go on: achieving goals, passing exams, showing to ourselves and to the rest of the people that we are improving our expertise and gaining knowledge. So, luckily, we can keep on with our path reaching what we thought was the top, at least at that point: we got a certificate! In the form of a BA, a Masters’s degree, or even a Ph.D. 

Reached that point, we think we have completed something but, on the contrary, doubts are more intense than ever. At least, the stats tell us we are not alone. Numerous studies show that it is common to suffer an existential crisis at the end of our studies. Be finally a grown-up, serious, predictable. It’s kind of scary, sure.

## The abyss

If there is one thing that the end of a training program leaves behind, it is emptiness. What do we know after all? What can we do now? How can we apply what we have been trained for after all? Responsibilities are coming closer. It’s impossible to run away. Make a career, make money, be happy… and the feeling of approaching the abyss arrives in our minds. Fun is over. And begins the unavoidable. 

In most cases, the end of the training is perceived as the end of a key period in our lives. However, it is more about what is coming next than what we left behind. The next stage began quickly. We need to get a job, be good people, make our living. Be honest, humble, active, competitive, successful, friendly, fitter, happier, more productive… altogether… no stress. 

So, the questions reach an even higher level: Are we really good at what we decided to devote our lives? Are we really attracted to what are we doing? Why should I do this? Are we doing something valuable? Are we making a real contribution? To whom? Are we free?


## Get off to a good start

Finger crossed, having a good start when choosing a first job is a crucial step in our careers. Ability or just luck. Whatever it takes. Getting into a good platform for landing in the professional realm can expand our horizons and increase our confidence in the long term. Seat belts on!

Not every company or project relies on young and talented people. But in the open-source context, [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/) appears to be safe territory for landing. As a growing project that focuses its work on communication between asynchronous APIs, AsyncAPI is a suggestive place to start: evolving, open-minded, communicative, empathetic… the project is all ears when talking about getting the best of young talents. 

Without hierarchy, no worries, no pain, AsyncAPI shows itself as the best platform for young coders to grow at their own pace. It fits like a glove. Since the beginning and throughout the different stages that the project has been reaching until today, the values and premises are clear, supported, and respected. Transparency and horizontality are unquestionable. People are at the forefront, goals will come later.

## A welcoming atmosphere

Collaboration, co-creation, engagement. They are undeniable. Nothing can be built without a bit of help from our new friends. That’s a whole new concept of what a work environment can be. 

Feeling comfortable, welcome, trustworthy is the only way to create a sense of belonging. So, AsyncAPI mainly relies on accepting difference as a virtue and valuing trust in people to construct a solid and coherent community. This combination is probably the secret to the constant growth of the community and of the project itself. 

The main motto is that everybody has something to contribute. The more eyes, the more perspectives. The first and main skill is the willingness and eagerness to learn. All people are welcome, and there is always someone ready to help those who need it. So, the idea of not knowing something can be finally compelling. Let’s watch it this way, as a blank page for starting. A fresh view.

After a hard journey, are we really forced to forget about our hopes and expectations when working? Can we still follow our dreams when making our living?

Let’s don’t forget the ideals that pushed us at the beginning. Let’s don’t blur or erase the old memories of a young student daydreaming about the possibilities of an utopian neverland. Maybe it’s worth being a little bit stubborn if we really feel that we are pulling together in the right direction.
