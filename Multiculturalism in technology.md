## Multiculturalism in technology and its limits
### AsyncAPI and the long road to utopia

>"Technology is not neutral. We're inside of what we make, and it's inside of us. We're living in a world of 
connections - and it matters which ones get made and unmade." 
Â¬Donna J. Haraway

The body is the best and the only tool that the human being has for life, it is the physical 
representation of who we are, the container in which we move and represent ourselves. It is 
the reflection of our identity, the matter that represents us socially. 

The perception we have of ourselves through our body image is socially and educationally 
conditioned since we are conscious. The mental image we have of ourselves is the image of 
our body in relation to our environment, directly influencing our behaviors and attitudes. 

Human beings have differentiated themselves from other animals by their ability to create 
tools, by the use of elements that increase their physical and mental capacities and extend 
their limits and mediate the way they see and understand the world. The body is, thus, 
transfixed and intermediated by technology. 

In the contemporary era, technological progress has led to global interconnection. Global 
access to the Internet has become the main propeller of globalization, a democratizing and 
liberating weapon. 

It is a place where the absence of corporeality manages to resituate us all at the same level. It 
is a pioneering experience in which the medium can favor equality. It offers a space of 
representation in which anonymity and/or the absence of gender and ethnic and cultural 
constraints facilitates the existence of equal opportunities.

**A temporarily autonomous zone**

In this way, the Internet has provided oppressed collectives and communities with a means of 
alleviating cultural and gender biases in which people express themselves free of socio-
political pigeonholing. The absence of a previous reference, of a historical past, turned the 
Internet into a "temporarily autonomous zone". A new space was thus constituted where 
identities could be expressed and constructed in a freer way. 

This same idea can be extrapolated to the new workspaces within technology. Now the 
workshop is on the network and is interconnected with colleagues who live in any corner of 
the world. This situation leads us to remote and teamwork, but also multiculturalism and all 
the positive aspects of this concept, creating diverse and heterogeneous teams where 
nationalities, ethnicities, and backgrounds are mixed. 

In this apparently idyllic world of the liberation of identities and construction of new spaces to 
inhabit, the shadows of the physical world, with a dense and unequal past, creep in.

**Opening doors (for whom? For all?)**

AsyncAPI is an initiative sustained and driven by its community. It is a free project whose 
objective is to be made up by all the people who want to be part of it. It follows the basic idea 
of being created by everyone for everyone.

Being part of the initiative is pretty simple: just joining the Slack channel and making the 
contributions you want through GitHub. People join freely and form a team that is managing 
to take this project to a high level.

But all freedom is conditioned by the context and the system that surrounds it. It is at this 
point where AsyncAPI as a project shows its limitations and feels a bit constrained. Talking 
about an open, inclusive, and enthusiastic community is a start. Potentially and hypothetically 
the doors are open. As are the doors to libraries. That does not mean that everyone will enter 
them. This is the clash against the glass ceiling that makes up the field of technology, 
specifically in software development. This conflict emerges from the impossibility of having a 
multicultural community rich in gender or ethnic identities and equality due to the limitations 
of the field. There is no widespread access and literacy to technology in all geographical and 
social contexts.

In 2019 the number of software developers in the world grew to 23.9 million, while is expected 
to reach 28.7 million software engineers by 2024. In these promising numbers, we find that 
there are huge inequalities. The majority of developers come from specific areas of the world 
and women represent only 10% of the total. 

**Towards a utopian future (let's try it!)**

These data show us that beyond the democratizing possibilities of the Internet, most of the 
advances are only hypothetical and not real. We can see approximately the same numbers 
reflected in our community. A community aware of what is happening and that wants to 
reverse this situation by being more heterogeneous and multicultural, but in which many 
factors influence. Not all are in our hands. 

The decisions taken now will be key to building a better future. A freer and more inclusive one. 
We do not want a unidirectional mirror where only some can see themselves reflected, let us 
work in the search for a diverse and multifaceted mirror.

Aspiring to form a community that is a melting pot of cultures and identities may seem 
somewhat utopian, but we believe it is a good goal to keep in mind and strive for. Let us at 
least try.
